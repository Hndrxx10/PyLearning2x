#Task #1
#Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in Python.
#What does the ** operator do in Python, and how is it used?
#What does the ^ operator do in Python, and in what context is it commonly used?

# 1. The = operator is used for assignment, while the == operator is used for comparison of equality.
# 2. The ** operator is the exponentiation operator. It is used to raise the left operand to the power of the right operand.
# 3. The ^ operator is the bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator. It performs a bitwise XOR operation on the operands, which means it returns 1 if the corresponding bits of the two operands are different, otherwise, it returns 0.



#Task #2
#Write a Python program to calculate the area of a circle given its radius using the formula area=_Ï€_Ã—_r^_2 ( Take pie as 3.14)
#pi = 3.14
#r = float(input("What is the radius?""\n"))
#area_of_a_circle = pi*r**2
#print("Area of the circle",area_of_a_circle)

#Create a program that takes two numbers as input and prints whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number.
#num1 = float(input("Enter First Number"))
#num2 = float(input("Enter Second Number"))
#print("First Number is greater than Second Number", num1 > num2)
#print("First Number is less than Second Number", num1 < num2)
#print("First Number is equal to Second Number", num1 == num2)

#Develop a Python script that calculates the square and cube of a given number.
x = input("Enter The Number")
x = int(x)
square = x **2
cube = x**3
print(square)
print(cube)
